#### Create and plot a simple nerve complex from an open cover, then compute the Combinatorial Laplacian score of a hardcoded binary feature

```{r}
library(RayleighSelection)
```

## Compute the nerve complex of an open cover
```{r}
gy <- nerve_complex(list(c(1,4,6,10), c(1,2,7), c(2,3,8), c(3,4,9,10), c(4,5)))
```

### Plot nerve complex
```{r}
plot_skeleton(gy)
```

## Compute 0-form and 1-form Comb. Lap. scores, p-value, and q-value
#### For the given binary feature on points
```{r}
rayleigh_selection(gy,t(as.data.frame(c(0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))))
```
